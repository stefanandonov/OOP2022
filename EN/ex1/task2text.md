Read from standard input data for unknown number of students (not more then 100). Each row of the data is in following format:
- first name
- last name
- ID number (format xxyzzzz) keep it as a char array (string)
- an array of the students grades (array of max 100 int)
- the number of grades (int)
separated with tab space.

Write a program that will print list of students, where each row will have: last name, first name, ID number, and average grade sorted by the average grade. BTW the names should be printed with first capital letter.
